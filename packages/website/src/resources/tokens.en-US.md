# Design Token

Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system â€” specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.

## List of Tokens

You need to install `@gio-design/tokens` package:

@import '~@gio-design/tokens/dist/variables.less';
